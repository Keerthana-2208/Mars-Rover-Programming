Mars Rover simulation to include the Singleton, Factory, Adapter, Composite, Command, and State patterns. Here’s how we can do it:

Singleton Pattern: Ensure that the grid is a single instance.
Factory Pattern: Create a factory for creating different types of commands.
Adapter Pattern: Use an adapter to adapt different types of commands to a unified interface.
Composite Pattern: Represent the grid and obstacles using the Composite pattern.
Command Pattern: Encapsulate the commands ('M', 'L', 'R') as objects.
State Pattern: Use the State pattern for the Rover’s direction.
